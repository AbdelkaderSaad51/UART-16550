# UART-16550
This repository contains the Verilog RTL implementation of the UART 16550 â€” a widely used serial communication protocol that supports configurable baud rates, parity, stop bits, and word lengths.
The design includes FIFO buffers, registers, transmitter, receiver, and interrupt logic, closely following the behavior of the original NS16550 UART.
